Installation Instructions
=========================

'Subreddit' should be changed to your subreddit name.

  1. Go to /r/subreddit/about/stylesheet
  2. Paste the CSS from the 'main.min.css' file into the CSS textarea.
  3. Upload the images from the /images/ folder. (Don't rename them!)
  4. Hit save!


Development
===========
All work should be done to the main.less file. A LESS compiler is require to convert the main.less file into CSS.
A CSS minifier is required to turn the CSS into minified CSS, which is what actually gets used in the subreddit.
